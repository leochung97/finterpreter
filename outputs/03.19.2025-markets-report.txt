- Retail sales rose 0.4% in February, slightly above expectations, suggesting consumer spending remains resilient despite high interest rates.

- Housing starts fell 2.1% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.41 million units, as high mortgage rates continue to weigh on the housing market.
