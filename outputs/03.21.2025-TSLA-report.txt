## Response

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Equity Research Report
March 21, 2025

Investment Summary and Rating: HOLD
Price Target: $300 (12-month)
Current Price: $225.31
Potential Upside: 33.1%

Tesla continues to face challenges in 2025 as competition intensifies and demand softens in key markets. While the company maintains its leadership in EV technology and autonomous driving capabilities, recent financial performance has disappointed investors. We maintain our HOLD rating but lower our price target to $300, reflecting both near-term headwinds and long-term growth potential.

## Key Financial Metrics and Recent Performance

• Revenue: $37.3 billion in FY2024, up 1% YoY
• Automotive Revenue: $34.0 billion in FY2024, down 6% YoY
• Net Income: $1.8 billion in FY2024, down 55% YoY
• EPS: $2.04 in FY2024, down 52% YoY
• Free Cash Flow: $2.1 billion in FY2024, down 63% YoY
• Vehicle Deliveries: 1.95 million units in FY2024, up 3% YoY

Tesla's financial performance in 2024 was disappointing, with automotive revenue declining and profitability significantly impacted by price cuts and increased competition. The company's growth rate has slowed considerably compared to previous years.

## Business Segment Analysis

Automotive:
• Vehicle deliveries grew 3% YoY to 1.95 million units in 2024
• Model Y remains the best-selling EV globally
• Cybertruck production ramp-up slower than expected
• Continued price cuts pressure margins

Energy Generation and Storage:
• Revenue grew 25% YoY to $3.3 billion in 2024
• Strong demand for Powerwall and Megapack products
• Energy storage deployments increased 80% YoY

Services and Other:
• Revenue increased 15% YoY to $5.4 billion in 2024
• Expansion of Supercharger network and insurance offerings

## Recent Product Launches and Technological Advancements

• New Model Y refresh launched in March 2025, featuring updated design and improved range
• Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta v12 released in January 2025, with enhanced AI capabilities
• Optimus robot production increased to 1,000 units per month in Q1 2025
• Next-generation 4680 battery cells now in full production at Giga Texas

## Market Position and Competitive Landscape

Tesla maintains its position as the global EV market leader, but competition is intensifying:

• BYD surpassed Tesla in global EV sales volume in Q4 2024
• Legacy automakers (VW, GM, Ford) continue to expand EV offerings
• New entrants like Lucid and Rivian gaining traction in premium segments

Tesla's key competitive advantages:
• Superior battery technology and efficiency
• Advanced autonomous driving capabilities
• Extensive Supercharger network
• Strong brand loyalty

## Forward-Looking Guidance and Management Commentary

From Q4 2024 earnings call (January 31, 2025):

• CEO Elon Musk: "We expect to launch our autonomous robotaxi service in Austin by June 2025, marking a significant milestone in our FSD development."
• CFO Vaibhav Taneja: "We remain on track to introduce a more affordable model in the first half of 2025, which will expand our addressable market."
• Projected vehicle deliveries for 2025: 2.2-2.4 million units (13-23% YoY growth)
• Capex guidance for 2025: $7-9 billion

## Valuation Analysis and Price Target Justification

Our $300 price target is based on a blended valuation approach:

1. DCF Analysis: $285 per share (60% weight)
   • 5-year revenue CAGR: 15%
   • Terminal growth rate: 3%
   • WACC: 9%

2. Relative Valuation: $323 per share (40% weight)
   • Forward P/E multiple: 65x (vs. sector median of 20x)
   • EV/EBITDA multiple: 30x (vs. sector median of 12x)

We apply a premium multiple to Tesla given its technology leadership and growth potential in autonomous driving and energy storage. However, we've reduced our target multiple to reflect increased competition and margin pressures.

## Key Risks and Opportunities

Risks:
• Intensifying competition in the EV market
• Potential delays in FSD development and regulatory approval
• Geopolitical tensions impacting Chinese operations
• Execution risks associated with new product launches
• Dependence on government incentives and regulations

Opportunities:
• Successful launch of robotaxi service
• Introduction of more affordable EV model
• Expansion of energy storage business
• Licensing of FSD technology to other automakers
• Potential breakthrough in battery technology
