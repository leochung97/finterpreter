Intel faces near-term margin pressures due to operating losses from Intel Foundry and start-up costs for 5N4Y, expected to peak in FY24. However, the company aims for 60% gross margins and 40% operating margins at the group level by 2030[3].

The company continues to focus on regaining its leadership position in the semiconductor industry, with key milestones for Intel 3 being met and plans to launch Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids for the DCAI segment in 2024[3].

While Intel's turnaround efforts show promise, the company still faces challenges from increased competition in the semiconductor market and exposure to the PC market and data center CPUs, which may hinder its ability to fully capitalize on the first wave of generative AI[3].
