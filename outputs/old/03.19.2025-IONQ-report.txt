## Response

Here is an equity research report for IonQ (IONQ) as of March 19, 2025:

## Business Overview

IonQ, Inc. is a leader in the quantum computing and networking industries, developing high-performance quantum systems aimed at solving complex commercial and research use cases. The company's current generation quantum computers, IonQ Forte and IonQ Forte Enterprise, feature 36 algorithmic qubits. IonQ sells access to its quantum computers through major cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as through its own cloud service[5].

## Recent News

- On March 19, 2025, IonQ announced its participation in NVIDIA's first-ever Quantum Day at the GTC 2025 event. IonQ Executive Chair Peter Chapman will join NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang on a panel to discuss quantum computing progress[13].

- IonQ reported Q4 and full year 2024 financial results on February 26, 2025. The company exceeded its 2024 revenue and bookings guidance[7].

- In January 2025, IonQ CEO Peter Chapman stated the company anticipates being profitable with sales approaching $1 billion by 2030[8].

## Last Twelve Month Financial Performance

For the full year 2024:

- Revenue: $43.1 million, up 95% year-over-year
- Net loss: $331.6 million
- Adjusted EBITDA loss: $107.2 million
- New bookings: $95.6 million
- Cash, cash equivalents, and investments: $363.8 million as of December 31, 2024[3]

- Market Cap: $4.86 billion
- Price-to-Sales (LTM): 112.8x
- EV/Revenue (LTM): 104.2x

IonQ is not yet profitable, so P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples are not applicable[10].

## 2025 Financial Outlook

For the full year 2025, IonQ expects:

- Revenue: $75 million to $95 million
- Q1 2025 revenue: $7 million to $8 million
- Adjusted EBITDA loss: $120 million (at midpoint of revenue guidance)[3]

## Analyst Ratings and Price Target

- Consensus Rating: Strong Buy
- Average Price Target: $44.80 (+105.32% upside from current price)
- Number of Analysts: 5[10]

## Investment Thesis

IonQ is positioned as a leader in the emerging quantum computing industry, with strong revenue growth and increasing commercial traction. The company's participation in high-profile industry events like NVIDIA's Quantum Day demonstrates its prominence in the field. However, IonQ faces significant challenges:

1. High cash burn rate and substantial losses
2. Intense competition from tech giants and other quantum startups
3. Uncertainty around the timeline for widespread quantum computing adoption

While IonQ's long-term potential is significant, the stock's current valuation appears stretched given the company's financial performance and the speculative nature of the quantum computing market. Investors should carefully consider the high risk-reward profile of this investment.

## Risks

- Technological setbacks or delays in quantum computing development
- Increased competition from well-funded competitors
- Potential dilution from future capital raises
- Regulatory challenges related to quantum technology
- Macroeconomic factors affecting tech investment

This report is based on publicly available information as of March 19, 2025, and should not be considered as financial advice. Investors should conduct their own research and consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
