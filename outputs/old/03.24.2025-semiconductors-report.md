## Industry Overview

The semiconductor industry is poised for significant growth in 2025, with global sales projected to reach $697 billion, setting a new record and keeping the industry on track to achieve $1 trillion in sales by 2030[1]. This represents a 11.2% increase from 2024's sales of $627 billion[1][2]. The industry's growth is primarily driven by the surging demand for generative AI chips, data center build-outs, and advancements in high-performance computing[1][2].

Key growth drivers for the semiconductor industry include:

1. Artificial Intelligence: AI has become the most important application driving semiconductor revenue for the first time[13]. The generative AI chip market is expected to exceed $150 billion in 2025[1].

2. Cloud and Data Centers: These have risen to become the second most important revenue driver for the industry[13].

3. Automotive Sector: While it has fallen from the top spot, the automotive sector remains a significant driver of semiconductor demand, particularly due to the growth in electric vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems[10].

4. Internet of Things (IoT): The increasing use of sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) across various sectors such as IoT, industrial, and healthcare continues to drive growth[13].

## Recent Industry News

1. New Fab Construction: The semiconductor industry is expected to start 18 new fab construction projects in 2025, including three 200mm and fifteen 300mm facilities[7]. This expansion is driven by the need to meet growing demand and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturing.

2. Supply Chain Normalization: Many industry insiders anticipate chip inventory rebalancing and normalization by early 2025[16]. However, this new "normal" may evolve into rolling periods of constraint environments for certain node sizes.

3. Talent Shortage: The industry continues to face challenges in talent acquisition and retention. As nontraditional semiconductor companies expand their chip capabilities, there is increased competition for skilled professionals[13].

4. Geopolitical Tensions: Territorialism and tariffs remain significant issues facing the semiconductor industry over the next three years[13]. This has led to efforts to diversify supply chains and reduce dependence on specific regions.

5. Sustainability Initiatives: The industry is increasingly focusing on sustainability, with efforts to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact in chip manufacturing processes[9].

## Last Twelve Month Stock Performance of the Sector ETF

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, provides a good representation of the sector's performance. As of March 24, 2025, the ETF's performance over the past 12 months has been as follows:

- Current Price: $224.77[11]
- 1-Year Performance: -1.26%[11]

Despite the projected growth in the semiconductor industry, the ETF's performance over the past year has been relatively flat. This could be attributed to various factors, including:

1. Market Volatility: The semiconductor industry is known for its cyclical nature, and the past year has seen fluctuations due to economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions.

2. Supply Chain Challenges: While improvements have been made, lingering supply chain issues have impacted some companies in the sector.

3. Valuation Concerns: After significant gains in previous years, some investors may have concerns about valuations in the sector.

4. Uneven Growth: While AI-related chip companies have seen strong growth, other segments like PC and mobile markets have experienced more muted demand[1].

It's important to note that while the overall ETF performance has been relatively flat, individual companies within the sector have shown varying performances. Companies with strong exposure to AI and data center markets have generally outperformed those focused on more traditional segments[1].

## Appendix: Industry-Specific Jargon

- Fab: Short for fabrication plant, a semiconductor manufacturing facility.
- Node: Refers to the size of transistors on a chip, measured in nanometers. Smaller nodes generally indicate more advanced technology.
- MEMS: Microelectromechanical systems, tiny integrated devices or systems that combine electrical and mechanical components.
- GPU: Graphics Processing Unit, specialized processors particularly important for AI applications.
- HBM: High Bandwidth Memory, a type of memory technology crucial for AI and high-performance computing applications.
