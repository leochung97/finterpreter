## Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Equity Research Report
### As of April 1, 2025

**Investment Rating: Hold**
**Price Target: $180**
**Current Price: $165.23**

## Investment Summary

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) continues to be a leader in the electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy markets, but faces increasing challenges in 2025. While the company maintains its innovative edge and brand strength, intensifying competition, margin pressures, and geopolitical factors have impacted its performance. We maintain a Hold rating with a price target of $180, reflecting both the company's growth potential and the risks it faces in an evolving market landscape.

Key factors supporting our Hold rating:

- Strong brand and technology leadership in EVs
- Expanding product portfolio and energy business
- Potential in autonomous driving and robotics
- Increasing competition and margin pressures
- Geopolitical risks and regulatory challenges

## Key Financial Metrics and Recent Performance

- **Q4 2024 Revenue**: $25.71 billion (2% YoY growth)[2]
- **Q4 2024 Adjusted EPS**: $0.73 (below analyst estimates of $0.78)[2]
- **FY 2024 Vehicle Deliveries**: 1.79 million (1% YoY decline)[19]
- **Q4 2024 Operating Margin**: 6.2% (down from 8.1% in Q4 2023)[1]
- **Energy Storage Deployments**: 11 GWh in Q4 2024 (record high)[12]

Tesla's Q4 2024 performance showed mixed results, with revenue growth slowing and margins under pressure. The company delivered a record 495,570 vehicles in Q4 2024, but annual deliveries declined for the first time in its history[12]. Operating margins contracted due to lower average selling prices and increased R&D expenses[1].

## Business Segment Analysis

### Automotive

- **Model Y**: Remains the world's best-selling EV[19]
- **Cybertruck**: Production ramp-up ongoing, with mixed market reception[10]
- **Model 3/Y**: Produced 436,718 units in Q4 2024[12]
- **Other Models (S/X)**: Produced 22,727 units in Q4 2024[12]

The automotive segment faces challenges from increasing competition, particularly in China and Europe. Tesla has responded with price cuts and the introduction of refreshed models[9].

### Energy Generation and Storage

- **Q4 2024 Deployments**: 11 GWh (record high)[12]
- **Annual Deployments**: 31.4 GWh in 2024 (nearly double 2023)[1]

The energy business continues to show strong growth, with record deployments in Q4 2024. This segment offers diversification and growth potential for Tesla.

### Services and Other

This segment includes Tesla's supercharger network, which has over 60,000 active chargers globally[13]. The expansion of this network supports Tesla's ecosystem and provides a competitive advantage.

## Recent Product Launches and Technological Advancements

1. **Model Y Refresh (Juniper)**: Launched in early 2025 with improved range and features[9]
2. **Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta**: Continued advancements, with plans for unsupervised service in Austin by June 2025[3]
3. **Optimus Robot**: Production target of 1,000 units per month in 2025[3]
4. **More Affordable Model**: Expected launch in first half of 2025, potentially named "Model Q"[14]

## Market Position and Competitive Landscape

Tesla maintains a strong position in the EV market but faces increasing competition:

- **Global EV Sales Rank**: 2nd worldwide after BYD in 2024[19]
- **Key Competitors**: BYD, Volkswagen Group, GM, Ford, Rivian, Lucid Motors[5]
- **China Market**: Facing strong competition from local manufacturers like BYD and Xpeng[1]
- **European Market**: Traditional automakers gaining ground with their EV offerings[1]

## Forward-Looking Guidance and Management Commentary

From the most recent earnings call (Q4 2024):

- CFO Vaibhav Taneja: "We will be introducing several new products throughout 2025. We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025 and will continue to expand our lineup from there."[14]
- Management expects vehicle sales to return to growth in 2025[2]
- Focus on cost reduction and efficiency improvements to maintain competitiveness[1]

## Valuation Analysis and Price Target Justification

### Opportunities:

1. Expansion into new markets and product categories
2. Advancements in autonomous driving technology
