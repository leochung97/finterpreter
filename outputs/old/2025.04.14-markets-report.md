## Economic Research Report: United States (April 14, 2025)

### Summary
The U.S. economy is experiencing a deceleration in growth as it navigates the effects of shifting trade policies, inflationary pressures, and a softening labor market. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 1.9% in 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024. Inflation remains elevated but is gradually moderating, while the labor market shows signs of cooling. Global economic conditions also reflect slower growth, with heightened trade barriers and policy uncertainty weighing on investment and consumption.

### Recent News
- **GDP Growth**: U.S. GDP growth is expected to decelerate to 1.9% in 2025, reflecting weaker household spending, higher tariffs, and reduced government contributions to economic activity. Growth is projected to slow further on a quarterly basis, with Q2 2025 growth estimated at 1.6% annualized[1][6].
- **Trade Policy Impact**: Tariffs implemented in 2025 have raised the effective U.S. tariff rate to 22.5%, the highest since 1909. These measures are expected to reduce real GDP growth by 0.9 percentage points in 2025 and increase consumer prices by 2.3%[2][9].
- **Consumer Confidence**: Consumer sentiment has declined sharply, with the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index falling by 9.8% in February 2025 due to inflationary concerns and tariff-related price increases[6].
