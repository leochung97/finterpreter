March 31, 2025

## Investment Summary and Rating

**Rating: Hold**

**Current Price: $278.08**
**Upside: 20.5%**

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) continues to lead the electric vehicle (EV) market but faces increasing challenges from competition and margin pressure. While the company maintains its innovative edge in technology and brand recognition, recent performance has been mixed. We maintain a Hold rating with a price target of $335, reflecting potential upside but acknowledging near-term headwinds.

## Key Financial Metrics and Recent Performance

- Q4 2024 Revenue: $25.71 billion (+2% YoY)
- Q4 2024 Adjusted EPS: $0.73 (+1% QoQ, +3% YoY)

- FY 2024 Vehicle Deliveries: 1.79 million (-1% YoY)
- FY 2024 Net Income: $7.09 billion (-53% YoY)
- Gross Margin (2024): 17.9%
- Operating Margin (2024): 7.2%

Tesla's financial performance in 2024 showed signs of slowing growth and margin pressure. The company experienced its first annual decline in vehicle deliveries, while net income dropped significantly due to increased competition and pricing pressures[1][2].

## Detailed Analysis of Business Segments

- FY 2024 Vehicle Deliveries: 1.79 million
- Model Y: Maintained position as world's best-selling EV

The automotive segment faced challenges in 2024, with revenue declining due to lower average selling prices across all models. However, the Model Y continued to perform strongly, maintaining its position as the world's best-selling EV[20].

### Energy Generation and Storage

## Market Position and Competitive Landscape

Tesla maintains its leadership in the global EV market but faces increasing competition:

- Plans for more affordable Tesla model confirmed, with production expected to start in 2025[2][3]

## Valuation Analysis and Price Target Justification

- Expected revenue growth from $112.091 billion in 2025 to $297.430 billion in 2030
- Projected normalized EPS growth from $2.85 in 2025 to $11.61 in 2030
- Ongoing margin pressures and increased competition
- Potential upside from FSD technology and energy storage solutions[1][7]
