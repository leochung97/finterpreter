## Summary

As of March 31, 2025, the U.S. economy is experiencing a period of moderation after strong growth in previous years. GDP growth is projected to slow to 1.9% in 2025, down from 2.9% in 2023 and 2.8% in 2024[1]. Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, with core PCE inflation expected to average 2.8% in Q4 2025[11]. The labor market shows signs of cooling, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% by Q4 2025[11]. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement two 25 basis point rate cuts in 2025, bringing the federal funds rate to 4.00%-4.25% by year-end[1].

## Recent News

- President Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported cars effective April 2, causing significant declines in auto stocks globally[9].
- Consumer confidence declined for the fourth consecutive month in March, falling below the range that had prevailed since 2022[8].
- The Federal Reserve held rates steady at their March meeting, signaling a cautious approach to future rate cuts[11].

## Global Economic Policy Changes

- The Trump administration's shifting policy mix is altering the economic outlook, with regressive policies like higher tariffs and federal workforce layoffs disrupting growth earlier than previously projected[1].
- Global growth is expected to moderate from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026, partly due to higher trade barriers in several G20 economies[14].
- The potential for heightened global policy uncertainty and adverse trade policy shifts poses a key downside risk to growth prospects across regions[10].

## Jobs Report

The labor market shows signs of cooling:

- Job growth is expected to decelerate from 160,000 per month in 2024 to around 80,000 per month in 2025[5].
- The unemployment rate is projected to rise above 4.5% by the end of 2025[5].
- The pace of job gains is forecast to fall under 100,000 a month by midyear 2025, compared to the three-month average of 200,000 a month in February 2024[1].

## Inflation Report

Inflationary pressures persist:

- Core PCE inflation is projected to average 2.8% in Q4 2025, above the Federal Reserve's 2% target[11].
- Headline CPI inflation is expected to pick up modestly in H2 2025, averaging 2.8% y/y in Q4 2025[5].
- Tariffs, confusion around trade policy, and tighter immigration policy contribute to upside inflation risks[5].

## Upcoming Economic Events

- March Employment Data: Scheduled for release on Friday, April 4, 2025[9].
- Trade Policy Developments: President Trump is expected to unveil plans for reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday, April 2, 2025[9].
- U.S. Trade Deficit Update: Anticipated on Thursday, April 3, 2025[9].
- Manufacturing and Services Sector PMI Data: Due early in the week of March 31, 2025[9].
- Federal Reserve Communications: Several Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak throughout the week, including Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, April 4, 2025, in Arlington, Virginia[9].

The economic outlook for 2025 remains uncertain, with risks tilted to the downside due to trade policy shifts, persistent inflation, and global growth concerns. Policymakers and market participants will closely monitor incoming data and policy developments in the coming months.
