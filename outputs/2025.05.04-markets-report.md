# U.S. Economic Research Report: May 4, 2025

## Summary

The global economic landscape is showing signs of deceleration as we move through 2025, with growth projections being revised downward across major economies. Global growth is expected to slow to 2.3% in 2025, falling below the 2.5% threshold often associated with a global recessionary phase. This marks a significant deceleration compared to pre-pandemic growth rates. The United States is demonstrating relative resilience with projected GDP growth of 2.2% in 2025, outperforming other advanced economies like the Euro area, which is projected at just 1.0% growth. However, persistent inflationary pressures, policy uncertainties, and financial market volatility continue to pose challenges to sustained economic expansion.

## Recent News

- **Global Economy Enters Potential Recessionary Territory**: As of April 2025, global growth is expected to slow to 2.3%, falling below the critical 2.5% threshold that typically indicates a global recessionary phase. This represents a sharp deceleration from pre-pandemic growth rates.

- **Financial Markets Experience Significant Turbulence**: In April 2025, growing concerns over the global economic outlook and shifting trade policies triggered major financial market corrections. The U.S. stock market volatility index reached its third-highest level on record, behind only the peaks during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 global financial crisis.

- **Economic Policy Uncertainty at Historic Highs**: In early 2025, the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index reached its highest levels this century, reflecting widespread concerns about the direction of economic policies globally.

## Global Economic Policy Changes

Recent months have seen significant shifts in economic policy across major economies. The ongoing geoeconomic fragmentation is creating additional headwinds for global growth. Policy uncertainty has reached unprecedented levels, with the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index hitting century-high readings in early 2025.

Trade policy shocks have been particularly disruptive, contributing to financial market turbulence and subdued demand. These policy shifts, combined with persistent inflation and slowing growth, have created a challenging environment for policymakers globally.

## Inflation Report

Inflation remains a persistent concern across major economies. According to the OECD's latest Interim Economic Outlook, inflation is projected to be higher than previously expected, although still moderating as economic growth softens. Annual headline inflation in G20 economies is projected at 3.8% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026, representing an upward revision of 0.3 percentage points compared to December forecasts.

Services price inflation remains elevated amid tight labor markets, and goods price inflation has begun picking up in some countries, although from low levels. This persistent inflation continues to challenge central banks' ability to support growth while maintaining price stability.

## Upcoming Economic Events

Several critical economic events and data releases are anticipated in the coming weeks that could significantly impact market sentiment and economic projections:

- Federal Reserve FOMC meeting scheduled for mid-May 2025
- Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report for April 2025
- Q1 2025 GDP final revision
- Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) releases for April 2025
- Treasury Department quarterly refunding announcement

These upcoming events will provide further clarity on the trajectory of the U.S. economy and potential policy responses to current challenges.

## Regional Growth Outlook

The global growth outlook varies significantly across regions:

The United States continues to outperform other advanced economies with projected growth of 2.2% in 2025, though this is expected to slow to 1.6% in 2026. The Euro area faces more significant challenges with growth projected at just 1.0% in 2025 and a slight improvement to 1.2% in 2026. China's growth trajectory continues its structural slowdown, with growth projected to moderate from 4.8% in 2024 to 4.4% in 2026.

These divergent growth paths reflect differences in economic structures, policy approaches, and exposure to global trade and financial conditions.
