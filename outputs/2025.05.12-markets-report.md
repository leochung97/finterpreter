## Response

Summary

The United States and global economies are navigating a period marked by subdued growth, heightened uncertainty, and significant policy shifts. As of May 2025, global growth projections have been revised downward, with the world economy expected to expand at a rate below pre-pandemic averages. Financial markets have experienced notable volatility, and the outlook remains clouded by persistent geopolitical tensions, trade disruptions, and structural challenges.

Recent News

In April 2025, global financial markets underwent sharp corrections amid escalating concerns over economic prospects and shifting trade policies. The US stock market volatility index, often referred to as the "fear index," surged to its third-highest level on record, surpassed only by the peaks during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 global financial crisis. This turbulence reflects widespread uncertainty, as the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index reached its highest point this century. These developments have intensified pressures on both advanced and developing economies, with vulnerable countries facing disproportionate risks from subdued demand, trade shocks, and financial instability[4].

Global Economic Policy Changes

Monetary policy has begun to ease in several major economies, responding to continued disinflation and softening commodity prices. However, the policy environment remains complex, with central banks balancing the need to support growth against the risks of reigniting inflation. Trade policy uncertainty has increased, with new restrictions and ongoing geopolitical tensions contributing to market volatility. The risk of geoeconomic fragmentation is rising, threatening to deepen the global downturn if left unaddressed[4][5].

Jobs Report

While the latest US jobs report for May 2025 is not available in the provided sources, the broader labor market context remains one of resilience but with signs of cooling. Global employment growth has moderated, reflecting slower economic expansion and persistent structural challenges. Many developing countries continue to struggle with high unemployment and underemployment, particularly among youth and vulnerable groups[5].

Inflation Report

Disinflation trends have continued into 2025, with inflation rates easing across most advanced economies. This has allowed some central banks to consider or implement rate cuts. However, inflation remains above target in several regions, and risks persist due to supply chain disruptions, commodity price fluctuations, and ongoing geopolitical tensions. The overall environment is one of cautious optimism regarding price stability, but vigilance is warranted given the potential for renewed shocks[5].

Upcoming Economic Events

Key upcoming events that will shape the economic outlook include:

- Central bank policy meetings in major economies, where further guidance on interest rates and monetary easing is expected.
- Release of updated US labor market and inflation data for May and June 2025, which will provide critical insights into the trajectory of the recovery.
- International summits addressing trade policy, climate change, and global economic cooperation, which may influence market sentiment and policy direction.
- Ongoing monitoring of geopolitical developments, particularly in regions experiencing conflict or heightened tensions, as these continue to pose downside risks to growth and stability.

In summary, the economic environment as of May 2025 is characterized by slower growth, persistent uncertainty, and evolving policy responses. The outlook remains fragile, with significant downside risks stemming from financial volatility, trade disruptions, and geopolitical instability[1][4][5].
