Equity Research Report
March 24, 2025

## Investment Summary

Rating: Hold
Price Target: $360 (57.48% upside from current price of $228.60)

Tesla continues to lead the electric vehicle (EV) market, but faces increasing competition and challenges. While the company maintains strong brand recognition and technological advantages, recent performance has been mixed. Tesla's expansion into energy storage and AI-driven autonomous vehicles presents significant growth opportunities. However, political controversies and production challenges have impacted investor sentiment. We maintain a Hold rating with a price target of $360, reflecting both upside potential and near-term headwinds.
